I'm a gaming creation enthusiast who's still a beginner, and I've just started learning the basics of Unity to create small apps for practice. Coincidentally, my music player's VIP subscription has expired, so I think it's a good opportunity to build my own music player for personal use and give my collection of 300 downloaded MP3s a proper home.
Given that this small software is made with Unity, I may only upload some key parts of it, which also includes libraries created by seniors. They are really amazing, and their help has made many complex and difficult problems for me much easier to solve.
